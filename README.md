# Student-Management-System
This C++ code is a basic student management system that performs the following operations on student data:

Add Student: Allows the user to enter a new student's name, roll number, and marks in 5 subjects, then saves this information to a file named "data.txt".

Display Student: Prompts the user for a roll number and displays the corresponding student's information (name, roll number, and marks). If the student is not found, it indicates so.

Delete Student: Prompts the user for a roll number and removes the corresponding student's information from the file.

Update Student: Prompts the user for a roll number and updates the marks for the corresponding student.

Show All Students: Displays the information of all students in the file.

Structs and Pointers: Uses structs to organize related data, showcasing how to handle complex data structures.

User Interaction: Implements a menu-driven interface, allowing users to interact with the program and choose various operations.

Error Handling: Includes basic error handling by checking for student existence during display, update, and delete operations.
